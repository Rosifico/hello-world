# hello-world
First repository serving as both an introductory location and storage area for ideas :)

Idea 1, Program that takes user input and reformats it for a specific purpose (Like a list on a chat-application.)

Idea 2, Survival game where enemies rush a base from one side. Player can view from side-sky view or in-person, upgrading their fortress and defending with units or by themselves. the self will always be stronger than the units though. Very much like Storm the house, but I would like to add my own elements to make it unique.
